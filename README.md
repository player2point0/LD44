Look after a herd of AI sheep, every so often you can breed survivng sheep to create a new sheep with the attributes of the parents. Keeping the best sheep alive and breeding them will allow you to essentially upgrade the herd. Protect the herd and keep them fed and watered.

The sheep and grass graphics come from google quick draw and I ideally wanted to generate new images on the fly, but couldnâ€™t figure it out in time. Instead it selects images from a small sample of the dataset.

The music comes from MuseNet and was generated and then I curated it.

The logic for the sheep and wolves is created by a neural network that was trained using reinforcement learning. Unity has a really simple toolkit for this ml-agents and all I had to do was define the rewards.
